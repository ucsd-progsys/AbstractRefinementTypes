\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Refinement types offer an automatic means 
of verifying semantic properties of programs
by decorating types with predicates from logics 
efficiently decidable by modern SMT solvers.
For example, the refinement type 
{@{v: Int | v > 0}@}
denotes the basic type \ttcode{Int} refined with a logical
predicate over the ``value variable" \ttcode{v}.
This type corresponds to the set of \ttcode{Int} values 
\ttcode{v} which additionally satisfy the logical predicate, 
\ie the set of positive integers.  
The (dependent) function type 
{@x:{v:Int| v > 0} -> {v:Int| v < x}@}
describes functions that take a positive argument 
\ttcode{x} and return an integer less than \ttcode{x}.
%
Refinement type checking reduces to \emph{subtyping} queries 
of the form ${\cstr{\Gamma}{\valu}{\tau}{p}{\tau}{q}}$,
where $p$ and $q$ are refinement predicates. 
These subtyping queries reduce to logical \emph{validity} 
queries of the form
${\dbrkts{\Gamma} \wedge p \Rightarrow q}$, which can be 
automatically discharged using SMT solvers~\cite{z3}. 
 
Several groups have shown how refinement types 
can be used to verify properties ranging from partial 
correctness concerns like array bounds 
checking~\cite{pfenningxi98,LiquidPLDI08} and data structure
invariants~\cite{LiquidPLDI09} to the correctness of security
protocols~\cite{GordonTOPLAS2011}, web applications 
\cite{SwamyOAKLAND11} and implementations of cryptographic 
protocols~\cite{FournetCCS11}. 

Unfortunately, the automatic verification 
%% (\ie automatic type \emph{checking} not inference)
offered by refinements has come at a price. 
To ensure decidable checking with SMT solvers, the 
refinements are quantifier-free predicates drawn from a
decidable logic.  This significantly limits expressiveness by 
precluding specifications that enable abstraction over the 
refinements (\ie invariants). For example, consider the 
following higher-order for-loop where @set i x v@ returns 
the vector @v@ updated at index @i@ with the value @x@. 

$$\centering
\begin{tabular}{c}
%
%for :: lo:Int -> hi:Int -> a<p lo lo> -> (i:Int -> a<p lo i> -> a<p lo (i+1)>) -> a<p lo hi>
\begin{code}
     for :: Int -> Int -> a -> (Int -> a -> a) -> a
     for lo hi x body      = loop lo x 
       where loop i x 
               | i < hi    = loop (i+1) (body i x)
               | otherwise = x
     
     initUpto :: Vec a -> a -> Int -> Vec a 
     initUpto a x n = for 0 n a (\i -> set i x) 
\end{code}
\end{tabular}$$

We would like to 
verify that @initUpto@ returns a vector whose \emph{first}
@n@ elements are equal to @x@. 
In a first-order setting, we could achieve the above with 
a loop invariant that asserted that at the $\ttcode{i}^{th}$
iteration, the first @i@ elements of the vector were 
already initalized to @x@. 
%
However, in our higher-order setting we require a means 
of \emph{abstracting} over possible invariants, each of which can
\emph{depend on} the iteration index @i@. 
%
Higher-order logics like Coq and Agda permit such quantification 
over invariants. Alas, validity in such logics is well outside the 
realm of decidability, and hence their use precludes automatic 
verification. %type checking.

In this paper, we present \emph{abstract refinement types} 
which enable abstraction (quantification) over the refinements 
of data- and function-types. Our key insight is that we can 
preserve SMT-based decidable type checking by encoding 
abstract refinements as \emph{uninterpreted} propositions 
in the refinement logic. 
%This insight yields the following contributions.
This yields several contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item First, we illustrate how abstract refinements yield a variety 
of sophisticated means for reasoning about high-level program 
constructs (\S \ref{sec:overview}), including:
\emph{parametric} refinements for type classes,
\emph{index-dependent} refinements for key-value maps,
\emph{recursive} refinements for data structures, and
\emph{inductive} refinements for higher-order traversal routines.

\item Second, we demonstrate that type checking remains 
decidable (\S \ref{sec:check}) by showing a fully automatic
procedure that uses SMT solvers, or, to be precise, 
decision procedures based on congruence closure~\cite{Nelson81},
to discharge logical subsumption queries over abstract refinements.

\item Third, we show that the crucial problem of \emph{inferring}
appropriate instantiations for the (abstract) refinement 
parameters boils down to inferring (non-abstract) refinement
types (\S \ref{sec:check}), which we have previously automated 
via the abstract interpretation framework of Liquid Types~\cite{LiquidPLDI08}. 

\item Finally, we have implemented abstract refinements in \toolname, 
a new Liquid Type-based verifier for Haskell. We present 
experiments using \toolname to concisely specify and 
verify a variety of correctness properties of several 
programs ranging from microbenchmarks to some widely-used
libraries (\S \ref{sec:experiments}).
